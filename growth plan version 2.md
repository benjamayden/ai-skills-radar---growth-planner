Formulating a Strategic Growth Plan

Version: 2.0

1. The Philosophy of Growth Plan Formulation
Formulating a successful growth plan, especially within a self-managed culture like Mayden's, is not a one-time administrative task. It is a strategic process of introspection, alignment, and articulation. The goal is to move beyond vague intentions ("I want to get better at X") to create a clear, compelling, and measurable objective that is meaningful to both the individual and the organization.

The core challenge this process solves is transforming abstract ambition into a concrete, living plan of action that has purpose and direction.

2. How a Growth Plan is Formulated: A Hybrid Approach
A robust growth plan is formulated by blending Mayden's unique cultural framework with proven industry-standard goal-setting principles.

Part A: The Mayden Foundation (The "Why")
Mayden's documents establish the foundational structure and purpose of any growth plan. The formulation process begins here.

Start with Reflection (The 'Personal Retro'): The process is initiated by looking inward and outward. It's about understanding your current position through 360-degree peer feedback and personal reflection. This isn't just a review of tasks completed; it's an evaluation against the "Universal Growth Enablers" and the "Values Personas." The key question here is: "Based on my recent work and feedback, where are my greatest strengths and my most impactful opportunities for growth?"

Define the Direction with Growth Dimensions: Once a growth area is identified, it must be framed using Mayden's four Growth Dimensions. This provides the strategic direction and answers the question, "What kind of growth is this?"

Depth: Am I aiming to become more of a specialist and deepen my expertise?

Breadth: Am I looking to become more versatile and expand my skillset into new areas?

Reach: Is my goal to expand my influence, leadership, and responsibility?

Range: Am I preparing to take on work of greater complexity or strategic importance?

Ensure Strategic Alignment: The final step in the Mayden-specific formulation is to ensure the goal "fits the business need." This means explicitly connecting the proposed goal to Mayden's Mission and its Foundational Objectives.

Part B: External Frameworks for Precision (The "How")
While Mayden's framework provides the "why," established external models provide the precision needed to make the goal tangible.

Make it SMART: The SMART framework is the industry standard for turning a directional goal into a specific objective.

Define the Metric with OKRs (Objectives and Key Results): The OKR model provides an excellent way to define the "M" in SMART. A goal is the Objective, and the Key Results are the measurable outcomes that prove the objective has been met.

3. A Platform to Formulate the Plan: "The Growth Architect"
This platform's sole purpose is to guide a user through the thinking process of formulating and evolving a high-quality, fully aligned growth plan. It is an interactive "thinking partner," not a task tracker.

Core Concepts of "The Growth Architect"
Dynamic Formulation Workspace: Instead of a linear wizard, the user interacts with a central workspace containing the core fields of a plan (Objective, Key Results, Alignment).

Field-Level AI Assistance: As the user types in each field, an AI Co-pilot offers real-time suggestions to improve clarity, specificity, and alignment.

Integrated Feedback: A dedicated panel allows the user to pull in and "assign" specific notes from their 'Personal Retro' or peer feedback to the goal they are crafting. This feedback directly informs the AI's suggestions.

Plan Quality Score: The AI continuously rates the plan's quality based on criteria like SMART principles, measurability of KRs, and strength of strategic alignment. A visual score (e.g., 85/100) gamifies the process, encouraging refinement.

AI-Generated Roadmap: Once the Plan Quality Score reaches a set threshold (e.g., 90/100), the user can "Generate Plan." The AI then produces a comprehensive roadmap document, including suggested milestones, key metrics, and potential next steps.

The Reflection Diary & Regeneration: A growth plan is a living document. The platform includes a "Diary" feature where users can log ongoing reflections, progress updates, and new feedback after the initial plan is generated. They can then use these new entries to "Regenerate" the plan, allowing the AI to update the roadmap with the latest information.

Proposed User Flow for "The Growth Architect" Platform
Phase 1: Initial Formulation

Setup Workspace: The user clicks "Create New Growth Plan." The screen displays a two-panel layout. On the left are the core plan fields: Objective, Key Results, Alignment. On the right is the "Inspiration & Feedback" panel.

Success Criterion: The user is presented with a clear, interactive workspace.

Gather Inspiration: In the right-hand panel, the user can see all their recent peer feedback and personal notes from their 'Personal Retro'. The user can drag and drop specific comments (e.g., a peer's suggestion) into an "Assigned Feedback" area for the current plan.

Success Criterion: The user has linked at least one piece of external feedback to the plan they are formulating.

Draft & Refine: The user begins filling out the fields on the left.

Objective: As they type "improve database," the AI Co-pilot appears beside the field, suggesting: "Let's make this more specific. How about 'Improve database performance for the main dashboard'? This is informed by [Peer]'s note about dashboard slowness."

Key Results: As they add a KR like "Make it faster," the AI prompts: "To make this measurable, let's add a number. For example: 'Reduce average query time by 20%.'"

Success Criterion: The user has filled out all core fields, iterating with the AI's real-time suggestions.

Reach Quality Threshold: As the plan improves, the "Plan Quality Score" at the top of the screen increases. It might go from 45/100 (for vague inputs) to 95/100 as the objective becomes specific and the KRs become measurable.

Success Criterion: The Plan Quality Score has surpassed the required threshold (e.g., 90). The "Generate Plan" button becomes active.

Generate Initial Roadmap: The user clicks "Generate Plan." The AI synthesizes all the inputs and produces a comprehensive, well-structured roadmap document that can be exported or saved.

Success Criterion: A clear, actionable roadmap document has been generated, including the goal, metrics, rationale, and suggested milestones.

Phase 2: Ongoing Reflection & Regeneration

Log Reflections: Weeks later, the user navigates to the "Reflection Diary" for this plan. They add a new entry: "Had a great chat with [Senior Dev]. They suggested that focusing on indexing would be the highest-impact 'quick win' for the dashboard performance goal."

Success Criterion: The user has successfully logged at least one new piece of reflection or feedback in the diary.

Regenerate the Plan: The user decides this new insight is significant enough to alter their plan. They return to the generated roadmap and click "Regenerate Plan." The AI re-processes the original goal plus the new diary entries.

Success Criterion: The AI produces a new version of the roadmap. The "Milestones" section might now be updated to say: "Milestone 1 (Updated): Investigate and implement new indexing strategy for core dashboard tables." The document clearly indicates it's an updated version, preserving the history of the old plan.
