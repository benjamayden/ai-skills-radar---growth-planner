Here's a summary of the main changes:
Universal Growth Enablers:
I've added a set of predefined soft skills (like "Self-Management & Accountability," "Clear Communication," "Collaborative Teamwork," etc.) based on the "Universal Growth Enablers" concept.
These skills are now automatically included in your identified skills list after the initial AI analysis.
They come with standard rubrics and are marked with a "Universal Enabler" chip on their cards for easy identification.
Holistic Growth Dimension Analysis in Growth Plans:
When you generate a growth plan for a focus skill, the AI now analyzes how developing that skill contributes to four key dimensions:
Breadth: Enhancing versatility and cross-functional contribution.
Depth: Deepening specialization and expertise.
Reach: Expanding involvement, responsibility, and the ability to shape work.
Range: Enabling you to tackle more complex, high-impact, or strategic work.
This analysis is displayed in a new section within your growth plans, offering a more strategic perspective on your development.
App Version Update:
The application version has been updated to "1.12.0" to reflect these enhancements.

Report: Building a Progression Framework Aligned with Mayden's Values and Strategy
Date: June 10, 2025

1. Introduction
This report details the development of Mayden's new progression framework, a strategic initiative designed to provide clear and meaningful career pathways for all employees. An analysis of internal documentation reveals a comprehensive system that is not merely a hierarchical structure but a holistic approach to personal and professional growth. The framework is deeply interwoven with Mayden's core values and foundational business strategy, ensuring that individual development directly contributes to the company's mission and long-term success.

2. Core Values & Strategic Alignment
The progression framework is built upon the foundation of Mayden's established values and strategic direction.

2.1. Company Values

The framework is an embodiment of Mayden's four core values, which are personified in day-to-day behaviours:

Forward-thinking: Creating a better tomorrow through thoughtful planning and innovation.

Contribution: Believing that everyone can make a valuable difference and share ideas.

Collaboration: Recognizing that working together produces the best outcomes.

Transparency: Seeking insight and sharing knowledge to foster engagement and innovation.

The "Values Personas" document further details these values, describing ideal behaviours such as being bold, questioning, open-minded, and enabling the best in others. The progression framework is designed to cultivate and reward these exact traits.

2.2. Strategic Objectives

The framework directly supports Mayden's mission to offer a market-leading healthcare SaaS product. It aims to develop individuals who can contribute to key strategic goals, including:

Working with growing and underserved services that are outcomes-focused.

Positioning Mayden as an expert in data, evidence-based care, and digital transformation.

Developing the product and organization for growth by evolving a culture of empowerment, autonomy, creativity, and innovation.

By fostering specific skills and capabilities, the framework ensures that the team is equipped to meet these ambitious objectives.

3. The Progression Framework Architecture
The framework provides a multi-dimensional view of employee growth, moving beyond simple job titles to capture the nuances of professional development.

3.1. The Four Growth Dimensions

Growth is measured across four key dimensions, creating a "T-shaped" model of expertise:

Breadth (The Horizontal Bar): Measures an individual's versatility and the variety of work they can undertake. It encourages the development of skills that allow for flexibility and cross-functional contribution.

Depth (The Vertical Bar): Represents an individual's specialization and deep expertise in a particular area critical to the business.

Reach: Defines the extent of an individual's involvement and responsibility—from contributor to instigator to overall lead. This dimension tracks the growth of autonomy and the ability to shape work.

Range: Gauges the complexity, risk, and business importance of the work an individual undertakes.

Together, Reach and Range define the overall level of challenge an employee is equipped to manage.

3.2. Levels of Progression

The framework outlines clear stages of development, exemplified by the "Development Team" model:

EARLY (Guided Contributor): The initial stage where individuals are developing their skills and contributing with guidance.

EXPERIENCED (Independent Contributor): The stage where team members work autonomously, guide others, and begin to shape projects and scale solutions.

ADVANCED (Expert Contributor): The highest level, where individuals are recognized experts who influence strategic direction, mentor others, and drive innovation across the company and industry.

4. Practical Application and Development
The framework is brought to life through actionable processes and a supportive learning culture.

4.1. Universal Growth Enablers

Success within the framework is supported by a set of "Universal Growth Enablers"—core competencies expected of everyone, regardless of role:

Embodying Values: Actively exhibiting the company's values personas.

Self-Management: Taking responsibility and exercising autonomy.

Mastering Core Skills: Developing proficiency in decision-making, feedback, agility, and effective communication.

Amplifying Others: Mentoring, coaching, and enabling the contributions of colleagues.

Being a Brand Ambassador: Representing Mayden appropriately in all external interactions.

4.2. The Personal Growth Cycle

Employee development is a continuous, structured process driven by the four-step "Personal Growth Cycle":

'Personal Retro': Gathering 360-degree feedback against goals and the framework's dimensions.

Reflect: Reviewing and evaluating the feedback to identify strengths and areas for growth.

Goal Setting: Defining development goals that align with both personal aspirations and business needs.

Put into Action: Pursuing goals through work-based opportunities, training, and other developmental activities.

An extensive Onboarding Track provides the initial foundation for this cycle, covering technical skills, company values, and core processes like Agile and Journey Mapping.

5. Conclusion
Mayden's progression framework is a thoughtfully designed system that aligns individual growth with organizational success. By defining clear growth dimensions, outlining distinct progression levels, and embedding the company's core values and strategic objectives at every stage, the framework empowers employees to build meaningful careers. It fosters a culture of continuous learning, collaboration, and impactful contribution, ensuring that as Mayden's people grow, so does the company's ability to innovate and lead in the healthcare technology space.


Progression Tooling: Requirements, Jobs to be Done, and User Flows
Date: June 10, 2025

1. Introduction
This document outlines the functional requirements, key data fields, user-centric "Jobs to be Done" (JTBD), and user flows for a digital tool designed to support the Mayden Progression Framework. The goal of this tool is to empower self-managed employees by providing a structured, intuitive, and transparent platform to navigate their personal and professional growth in a way that aligns with Mayden's core values and strategic objectives.

2. Required Data Fields & Core Concepts
The tool must be built around the core concepts of the progression framework. The following data fields will be required to capture the necessary information for the "Personal Growth Cycle."

2.1. User Profile Fields:

Employee Name: The name of the individual.

Role/Team: The user's primary role or team.

Cycle Period: The timeframe for the current development cycle (e.g., "Quarter 3 2025").

2.2. Goal-Setting Fields:

Goal Title: A concise name for the development goal.

Goal Description: A detailed description of what the user wants to achieve.

Goal Type: A category for the goal (e.g., Skill Development, Project Contribution, Leadership Growth).

Alignment to Growth Dimension: A required field to link the goal to one or more of the four dimensions:

Breadth

Depth

Reach

Range

Alignment to Company Value: An optional field to connect the goal to one of Mayden's values (Forward-thinking, Contribution, Collaboration, Transparency).

Success Metrics: How progress and completion will be measured (e.g., "Complete X certification," "Successfully lead Y project").

Target Completion Date: The user-defined deadline for the goal.

Status: The current state of the goal (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed, On Hold).

2.3. Feedback & Reflection Fields ('Personal Retro'):

Feedback Provider: Name of the person giving feedback (can be self or peer).

Feedback Content: A text field for qualitative feedback.

Evidence/Examples: A field to link to specific work or situations that support the feedback.

Reflection Summary: The user's personal summary of all feedback received during the cycle.

2.4. Action & Opportunity Fields:

Action/Opportunity: A specific task, training course, or work-based opportunity to support a goal.

Link to Goal: A direct association with one of the user's active goals.

Resource Links: URLs to relevant training materials, documentation, or project boards.

Action Status: (To Do, Done).

3. User Jobs to be Done (JTBD)
From the perspective of a self-managed employee, the progression tool must help them accomplish the following key jobs:

When I am planning my growth, I want to...

...clearly understand what 'good' looks like so that I can set meaningful goals that are valued by the company.

...see how my personal aspirations can align with the company's strategic needs so that I can make a valuable contribution.

...structure my goals around the four growth dimensions (Breadth, Depth, Reach, Range) so that I can ensure I am developing a balanced, T-shaped skill set.

When I am reflecting on my progress, I want to...

...easily gather 360-degree feedback from my peers and myself so that I can get a well-rounded view of my performance and impact.

...have a single place to review all my feedback and evidence so that I can identify patterns and key development themes.

...document my reflections and learnings so that I have a record of my growth journey over time.

When I am executing my development plan, I want to...

...break my large goals down into small, actionable steps so that I can make consistent progress.

...find and track relevant learning opportunities (e.g., training, projects, mentoring) so that I can acquire the skills and experience I need.

...visualize my progress towards my goals so that I stay motivated and can see the impact of my efforts.

4. Core User Flows
The following user flows describe the primary journeys a user will take through the progression tooling.

4.1. User Flow: The Full Personal Growth Cycle

This flow represents the end-to-end process a user follows each development cycle.

Initiate New Cycle:

User logs in and clicks "Start New Development Cycle."

The system creates a new cycle record, timestamped for the current period.

Gather Feedback (The 'Personal Retro'):

User navigates to the "Feedback" section.

They can request feedback from peers by selecting names from a directory.

Peers receive a notification and a simple form to provide feedback linked to the user's cycle.

User adds their own "Self-Reflection" feedback.

All feedback populates on the user's private cycle dashboard.

Reflect and Synthesize:

User reviews all collected feedback.

User writes a "Reflection Summary," identifying key strengths and development areas for the upcoming cycle.

Set Goals:

User navigates to the "Goals" section and clicks "Add New Goal."

User fills out the required goal fields (Title, Description, etc.), crucially linking each goal to at least one Growth Dimension.

User saves the goal, which now appears on their dashboard.

Define and Track Actions:

For each goal, the user adds specific "Actions" or "Opportunities."

As the user completes actions (e.g., finishes a training course), they mark them as Done.

The system could show a progress bar on the parent goal as actions are completed.

Review and Close Cycle:

At the end of the period, the user reviews their goals, updating statuses to Completed or carrying them over.

The user officially "closes" the cycle, archiving it as a record of their development for that period.

4.2. Micro-Flow: Requesting Peer Feedback

From the main dashboard, user clicks "Request Feedback."

A modal appears where the user can select one or more colleagues.

The user can add a custom note (e.g., "Could you provide feedback on my contribution to Project X?").

The selected colleagues receive an in-app notification and/or email with a direct link to a simple feedback form.

The form contains fields for "Strengths," "Areas for Growth," and "Specific Examples."

Once submitted, the feedback appears on the requester's (private) "Personal Retro" board.
